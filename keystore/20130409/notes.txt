    Ordered a Certificate through no-ip.com
20130411 
    received cert from GeoTrust
    I have imported the certifcate into the viaoa.jks
        when I use it with jarsigner, I get the following warning:
        
     Sign:
     [signjar] Signing JAR: C:\Projects\java\ViaOA\dist\oa.jar to C:\Projects\java\ViaOA\dist\oa.jar as viaoa
     [signjar] Warning: 
     [signjar] The signer certificate's ExtendedKeyUsage extension doesn't allow code signing.
