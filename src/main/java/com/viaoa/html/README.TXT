

The oa.html code is from 2002, which is being used for VetJobs 2008

VetJobs4.0 is using OA2.6, with the exception of oa.html, which is from the 2002 version of Vetjobs

The later version of oa.html (after 2002) had too much code relating to framesets, etc. and 
was too difficult to get working for VetJobs4.0 (2008)
