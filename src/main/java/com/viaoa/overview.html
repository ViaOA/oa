<b>Object Automation (OA) by Via Object Architects (ViaOA, Inc.)</b>
<p>

<i>"All programs are made up of objects and collections of objects."</i>
<p>
OA automates how they work together.

<p>


The OA Platform is a model driven, reactive, observable, componentized, distributed, synchronized, dynamic, functional, secure, small foot print, high velocity system for building Applications. 
<p>

The OA library offers solutions that use software patterns and techniques that allow for high reuse and functionality.  
<p>

The focus is on <i>creating software that creates software</i>, where most of software development can be automated.   
This is first done by focusing on the computer science patterns within software development.
<p>

Using a model driven approach, where a model can be visually developed and defined.
This allows a system to be organized in a way that gives high functionality, development velocity, and a reiterative constant improving software development process.  
<p>


Each package in OA defines these patterns and techniques.

<p>

At the core of OA is the object model that is an object-relational, observable, reactive, functional, distributed object graph.
This graph of objects and collections automatically work with persistence layers, frameworks, UI, reporting, microservices, and more.
<p>
The Model Driven approach defines the entities, relationships, persistence, business logic, security, UI, endpoint access, work-flow and more.
<p>
Full software systems can be visually designed and then automatically generated using the OA library, OABuilder visual modeling tool, along with the OA.G2 code generation

<h2>Key Concepts for automation</h2>

<ul>
<li>observable objects and collections - core for allowing reactive object graphs
<li>property paths - dot separated paths for interacting with object graphs
<li>remoting/distributed - allows scaling and failover, where everything works like a single application.
<li>datasource independent, ORM, XML, JSON, yaml, REST, ... - any data, anywhere 
<li>desktop UI - automated rich components - rich UI and reporting
<li>web UI - componenized web apps.
<li>reflective - techniques for automating interactions using object graphs, components and code.
<li>metadata - object data, discovery, and includes business rules, security, callbacks, so that the model is the core.
<li>functional - realtime filtering, merging, object graph, visiting, joins, groups, more.
</ul>
