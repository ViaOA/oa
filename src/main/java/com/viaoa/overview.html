<b>Object Automation (OA) by Via Object Architects (ViaOA, Inc.)</b>

<center>
<i>"All programs are made up of objects and collections of objects."</i>
OA automates how they work together.
</center>
<p>


<p>
<b>Overview of OA Packages</b>
<p>

<u>Package <b>com.viaoa.object</b></u><br>
OAObject is used as the base class for representing custom entity classes.
OAObject includes built in functionality to be able to automate interactions with other objects/components.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Observable - changes made to an object automatically updates other objects.
<li>Annotated - defines information about the object and the relationships with other objects.
<li>Reflective - all components that work with OAObject can work with any custom subclass. 
<li>Synchronization with other computers - messaging between applications so that objects are synchronized.  
<li>Automatically work with other objects - UI components, datasource (database/XML/binary/etc),  
<li>Calculated Properties - changes that affect a calculation (formula) are automatically recaclulated.
<li>XML support
<li>Database support (database independent)
<li>Cross application support
<li>Locking support

<li>Automating relationships between OAObjects:
<ul>
<li>one to one
<li>one to many
<li>many to many
<li>recursive - parent has many children of same Class.
</ul>
Relationship rules include ownership, cascading, etc.
</ul>


<br>
<u>Package <b>com.viaoa.hub</b></u><br>
The Hub is a collection class used with OAObjects.  OAObject classes use Hub collections to represent 
relationships between other OAObjects.
The Hub is an observable collection, with the additional functionality to manage the observable events
of the objects that are contained in the collection.
<br>


<p>
<u>Package <b>com.vioa.ds (datasource)</b></u><br>
Includes main interface, OADataSource, used for storing and retrieving Objects from a persistent datasource 
in a way that is independent from the Objects.  This includes Relational Databases, XML, serialized files, 
legacy systems, application servers, etc.  Included with OA is datasource that uses JDBC to automatically 
store/select/retrieve objects from a Relational Database. 
<p>
All selects/queries for retrieving objects are based on an Object Query Language that is based on
Class structure, and not on datasource structure.
<p>
OAObject has built in methods for automatically working with any OADataSource.  Methods that include save, 
delete, and initialization of object when object is created.  

<p>
<u>Package <b>com.viaoa.jfc (user interface components using Java Swing)</b></u><br>
Object Aware visual components used for building Graphical User Interfaces.  Similar to databound components, 
Object Aware components use OAObjects instead of a database.  Package currently has the Java Foundation 
Classes (JFC) subclassed to automatically work with any OAObject or Hub Collection.

<p>
<u>Package <b>com.viaoa.html</b></u><br>
Similar to com.viaoa.gui package, visual components that automatically work with frames, forms, and form
components.  Includes components for building Web Applications using Java Server Pages (JSP).

<p>
<u>Package <b>com.viaoa.util</b></u><br>
Includes utility Classes for strings, dates, times, converters, and more.   Data converters are used to convert 
from one type to another, commonly used to convert to/from Strings to another variable type.  Data formatters 
are also included.
