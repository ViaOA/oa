        Could you also include a sample set of the data that is being pulled from Oracle DB?
        next week:
        >  I dont have a way to get this right now, but I will plan to get an XML output of the data.  I can do this at the beginning of next week, if that timeframe is ok.
    Chase
        Chase and I had a discussion on this.. and based on everyone�s availability we can do the handover from Chase to Vince either this or next week or early next year. 
        One interesting thing that also came out was that Chase writes all the SF updates into oracle too. So, that is something we can discuss further when we meet to take over the code. 
        >  I'll meet up with Chase soon to discuss, and get started on a requirements doc for this.
