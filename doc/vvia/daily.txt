DNS for gsmr
gsmr clients: 
    gsmr.server=gss
    gsmr.port=80

if you are running local you will need to use the full DNS, ex:
    example: gss.am.rv.intcx.net

track gs logout
    does not use callback

Vinod/Ram
    nil error message
        send gs error msg

20130712 Friday
    Fixed: Bugs in MS-like Log file

    Fixed: error reporting for GS error from GCI
        For every GCI request - GS returns the result in an array. 

        resultArray[0] ? actual result bytes if api was successful.
        resultArray[1] ? the exception string if result could not be returned. 

        So for failure case GS will return the exception string in resultArray[1] and IFL will copy that back as IFLMessage.arguments.

GIT issue with GSMR Client 12.725

Damian Monogue 3:19 PM
hey Vince... just had another thought on what might have happened to that branch. 
you made the branch, 
it looks like, so if it was pushed using 'git push' and not 'git push -u' then it 
may not have set the upstream to pull from initially 
could be that setting has been absent since the branch was made and pushed. 
Damian Monogue 3:22 PM
upshot being, if you make another branch to push to the remote, check the 'git remote show origin' output 
to see if it sets up the 'pull' portion and not just the 'push' portion 
or ping me and I'll help. heh 

git branch >>> 

add this to file:
C:\projects\java\GSMR\Installer\.git\config

example:
    [branch "12.725"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/12.725

The following Class methods in class System are available to help you keep track of the load on temporary object memory:

            _tempObjSpaceUsedReturns the approximate number of bytes of temporary object memory being used to store objects. 
            _tempObjSpaceMaxReturns the approximate maximum number of bytes of temporary object memory which is usable for storing objects.

            _tempObjSpacePercentUsedReturns the approximate percentage of temporary object memory that is being used to store temporary objects. This is equivalent to the expression:

            (System _tempObjSpaceUsed * 100) // System _tempObjSpaceMax. 
            It is possible for the result to be slightly greater than 100%; this indicates that temporary memory is almost completely fu

        that sounds good ... I'll check to make sure that it creates it as a Java long

GSRM retry  Jeremy and I will be working on some solutions for the new GSMR update that will give us more data on the impact of retries and timeouts.
    client needs to report number of retries, and amt of time
        >> add new remote method
        >> add retryCount to requestInfo
    client needs to send retry count in request to gsmrserver
    gsmr server should not log warnings for all
        ex: 281k on Thursday night - only show that retries are happening, and when it stops
    *** I'm looking at just sending one warning/alert when the GSMR gets into a all connections busy state, and then report again when it ends. 
    verify that retry wait time if correct for login request retries

interview with John Thomas
boolean bVoidReturn = (void.class.equals(methodInfo.returnClass));

This looks to be a GSMR Client bug.   Since the "requestSystemLogout(..)" does not return a value (it's set as "void"), the GSMR Client should  not expect a result.  
    TTS-8230 The Gemstone methods no longer support/require the corba like (from Marketservers) method signatures that have IN and OUT params. Gary has made the GS changes to always return a value that includes all of the previous Out params.

GSMR 12.800.07 release
    1) This has the change to allow for setting the GCI connection stagger time.  This is the config setting
    in the server.ini file:
         msStagger = 500

    2) creates 60 copies of the IFL/GCI library during installation. 
    3) At startup, if any GCI connection is "stale", then a new lib (up to max 60) will be used to establish the connection.

    I have tested in Dev2, debugged, and created failure conditions, and everything worked/responded as expected.
    No GSMR Client changes.

Jira GSMR-20
add GSMR stagger time as config setting, GCI reconnect using new lib
    create 60 copies of libs

I'm Blessed, changed for ever

Spirt: do you trust me?

I must gain her trust and love through the Lord
    no longer just words or belief
    Can not not ...

I'm ruined, spent, one step from being lost forever, and falling ... all at once

reading glasses, poses, hair, voice, singing, dance (ouch), way she moves,
simple, "boring", prius, independent, quiet, hiking (walks fast),
fun to message, as a mom, no drama :):):)
    Spirit matched us
        she gets me, I get her - meant to be

mistake w/ profile divorced. 
    Spirit's lession: shows eqo getting in the way, not trusting
    ego: jealous

I want to sign up for this
    risk of heart break
    usually what you hear that a woman experiences?
        makes them guarded, insecure
    
I dont deserve this, not worthy
    work, OA, home, $$, passions, silver, love, kids
        Spirit: do you trust me

Zen - definition: something difficult and worthy that is made to look easy
    knowing, purpose, cant not do it

honor her
    love, best friend, supportive, fan, pamper, gentleness, kindness,
    quiet place, open heart, offer my best (red carpet/silver platter)
    know her heart
    give her space, to grow, expand into her fullest potential
        watch her move, and be

 "INSERT INTO x VALUES(N'<unicode_here>')
 same with select params

In my INSERT statment I did the following :
    INSERT INTO <table> (text) values (N'<text here>)
    Notice the "N" prefix... It seems that only at Install time, we can change the default charset. But using the N prefix seems to "force it" in unicode.

    found the solution. When updating a SQL Server 2005 NVARCHAR column, you have to use the following syntax:
    UPDATE <table> SET <column> = N'<value>'
    
    
stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO unifun
VALUES(1,N'\u20AC\u20AC\u20AC the wrong way')");
PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO
unifun VALUES(?,?)");
pstmt.setInt(1, 2);
pstmt.setString(2, "\u20AC\u20AC\u20AC the correct way");
pstmt.executeUpdate();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT id,data FROM unifun");
while(rs.next()) {
System.out.println(rs.getInt(1) + " : " + rs.getString(2));

oaObj.change, new
    needs to cange oaObj.hubs to weak or Not

figured out how to know that oaobject finalize should save the obj
    instead, changed oaObject.hubs to be Object[], that is either Hub (only on server) or WeakRef<Hub> (default)
        if an obj is changed on the server, then it changes from WeakRef to Hubs, so that it does not get GCd

    fixed read() -> readFully in inputStreamController

    from Jason Jones
        this is a buildr job not Maven
        with buildr jobs its a separate job that does the release
        you won't get a "perform maven release"
        If you want to do a release you need to use this job:

Fabian Cruz 1:29 PM
Hey was wondering if you had chance to look into what we should be searching for in the GSMR logs
    Here's the log info that can be used to find GCI connection errors.  btw: this will be added to TSAC in 13.000

    Log file name:
                    2015-07-10-rv-dv3-uxgsmr-01_GSMR_1_console-092209.log

    This is in every log at startup:
                    CONFIG: all GCI verified=true, valid gci connection count=10

    Look for this:
    This will only show up if there is an issue getting GCI connections
                All GCI connections could not be established, valid gci connection count=9, total requested=10

    the numbers will vary, so you can grep for the first part.
