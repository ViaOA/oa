Parisa,

Unless I have to pay for this at this time, I’d like to hold off until some questions are answered and issues are resolved.  Some of these concern the cost, treatment and usefulness of getting this done, along with getting a second opinion.

There are open issues that need to be resolved.  Ed is correct that this has been contentious, as I’m sure he will discover first hand on his own.

Open issues and questions:
1: the ambulance and emergency room visit from Rachel drinking on the beach.  I have not received anything yet, even though it happened on July 4th.  This could be expensive.
2: the need for braces, and getting a second opinion.  If Rachel is still sucking her thumb (not sure about this, it’s what I heard from Christine in an email).
3: status at school.  I do not even know if she is enrolled or home schooled.  I do know that she did not do well last year.
4: how do I know that the directions and procedures for the braces will be followed? 

Christine has caused so many issues between the kids and I.  There has been very little contact between them and I for over a year.  PAS is an accurate description and is the real issue behind all of this. Christine’s actions and behavior are not normal.  She wants to make sure that the kids are not part of my life.  The level of garbage (white trash) has been amazing. 

Rachel and the boys have all said that they don’t want anything to do with me.  This was not this way before the divorce started.  They can contact me anytime to change this.

Thanks, feel free to pass this on to Ed.
