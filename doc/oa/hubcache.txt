is set, then the OAObject class will not have a property for the Hub, and OAObject.properties will use a weakReference to it.
OALinkInfo will then keep the last cacheSize references.  The cacheSize is the amount of client apps, the Server will user cacheSize*10 as the max.


caching support
    OALinkInfo.cacheSize > 0
        determines how many hubs are kept, this is for client apps, server will use * 10
    HubDelegate.setReferenceable (used by server only)
        used to make sure that hubs that are changed do not get GCd before the changes can be saved to DS
        called by
            HubAddRemoveDelegate.add & remove
                if server, and LinkInfo.Many & cacheSize>0
                    add to hsHubCache
            Hub.save
                removes from cache
            OAObject.setChanged
                if changed=true and not already set
    HubDelegate.clearReferenceableCache
        used to clear the cache after a Save is done
