   custom oa object
   





"Object Arcanum"

OA Import/export tool
    prop editor


xml output: need to use namespace to replace com.viaoa.build.model, com.viao.hub, etc.

        client-server
        
        
        OAHTMLTextPane.getImage(...) replace to supply images from DB,etc
        OAHTMLTextPaneController.onInsertImage(...) inserts new image        
    






========= START -- Verify this 
HubEventDelegate.java
    public static void addHubListener(Hub thisHub, HubListener hl, String property)
                     removeHubListener(...) 

    qqq remove or clean up
    public static void addHubListener(Hub thisHub, HubListener hl, String property, String[] properties)

HubCalcEventListener.java

OAObjectEventDelegate.java
    sendHubPropertyChange

========= END -- Verify this 







Hub.vecAdd, vecRemove need to be synchronized within code

System.getProperty("line.separator")





put flag in OASelect to know if it has been ran or not

Hub. option to not use a Hashtable(?)

Use resource file
Use Local setup

DataSource needs to get reference properties from hashLink, not by calling getProperty().  A key might be all that is stored and
  calling getProperty() will "go" get the value instead of just returning the key

** cut down the amount of HubEvents

Create OAUnDo manager so that it will plug into OAObject - OAObjectUndoDelegate

Have OABuilder generate Datasource that it can set properties at a field level, since it will be in the
   same package as the OAObjects and will have access to the protected fields/properties

?? create OAObject methods that can be overwritten allowSave, Delete, Cancel

could there be a problem when reading in a serialized object as it is changed by another thread?

clean up OAObjectInfo

HubCalcEventListener - replaced
    create HubListenerTree to control hub listeners.
    all dependent properties are put in tree, using HubMerger for propertyPaths
        very efficient - shares common paths
        removes dependent listeners on hub.removeListener(hl)
    HubListenerTree allows dynamic creation of property with dependent propertyPaths
        if dependent pp is changed, then a propertyChanged event is sent to AO of main property
    moved HubCalcEventListener.java to hold directory        
    OAObjectEventDelegat - updated to use new HubListenerTree         
    HubDataUnique - replace vecListener with treeListener                
    OATableColumn - replaced using hubMerger with hubListener(prop, path)
