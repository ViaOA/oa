ViaOA is currently making their development tools available at no cost to a limited number of developers.  We are looking to get feedback from other developers before we release version 1 sometime in May.  Source code is also available.

OA can automate over 90% of software development so that developers can concentrate on custom features.
OA packages/objects add the functionality to existing Java APIs so that everything works with your objects: JFC,JSP,DataSource.
OABuilder is a Visual Development Tool for defining and creating objects and object relationships and then building applications and datasource/database that automatically works with these objects.  OABuilder will also include a rules engine and reverse engineering capabilities.

OA is not a framework or 4GL.  It is all pure Java and works by adding key functionality to existing objects/APIs (that developers are already familar with) and by connecting objects together.

 and is very easy and natural to learn and use.
